# Industrial-Copper-Modeling
# Overview
This project aims to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using machine learning techniques. The project also includes creating an interactive GUI using Streamlit for model prediction.
# Data Preprocessing
* Handle missing values with mean/median/mode.
* Treat outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest.
* Identify and treat skewness in continuous variables using appropriate transformations.
* Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques.
# Model Building and Evaluation
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Train and evaluate different classification and regression models.
* Optimize model hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search.
* Interpret model results and assess performance.
# Model GUI
* Create an interactive GUI using Streamlit for model prediction.
* Perform feature engineering, scaling, and transformation steps used for training ML model.
